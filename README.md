The following represents a work in progress.

_This app package is developed by MooCloud MSP. It requires a MooCloud License to start._

This NGINX-PHP-FPM L2 App package gives you complete control over your webserver while offering the high performance benefits of Nginx all in one.

Non-exhaustive list of unique features our package includes:

- Edit and upload content with FileZilla and similar thanks to our SFTP support
- Directly access the Nginx configuration files
- Make use of our superior optimization tools
- Optimize content-delivery with our pre-installed FastCGI caching system
- Manage your installation with our powerful MooCloud CLI

## Nginx vs Apache
While Apache has a longer history and is known more widely, in recent time it became clear that Nginx is the modern alternative providing sleek high-performance for medium to large website providers while proving itself to be managed much more easily. For example, if you have several visitors, Nginx can serve static files without any PHP intervention, maximizing content-delivery throughput. On top of that, Nginx uses PHP-FPM, which is a new and improved version of CGI used by Apache. Due to its asynchronous nature, Nginx can spawn and manage FPM processes much more effectively and efficiently than Apache can with CGI.
